# PicoPlacaPredictor
 This is a Pico y Placa Predictor built with JavaSE-11.
 The project used JUnit 5.
 
 ## Problem to solve üîç:
 
Using the language that you feel most proficient in, we‚Äôd like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time. The program should return whether or not that car can be on the road. You may use any input and output method you prefer. Although it is not required, we‚Äôd love to see the following in your code for extra points:
* Good object-oriented code, avoiding repetition and favoring a consistent organization. You should stick to your chosen language‚Äôs semantics, and try to be as   consistent as possible.
* Correct usage of version control tools, with a good commit history and incremental software delivery practices.
* Automated testing with any framework or tool of your choice.

### Note üìù: 

Consider the past rules of the Pico&Placa. (Hours: 7:00am - 9:30am / 16:00pm - 19:30)
